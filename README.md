# Date-Finder
## A python program that finds dates and validates them. 
This is the first project of chapter 6 in the Automate the Boring Stuff book. I spent most of my time working on this regex. Once I got to the validation part of the project I quickly realized that testing was restrained by the regex. Part of me wants to clean up my code a little bit but most of me wants start the next project and write more code.
